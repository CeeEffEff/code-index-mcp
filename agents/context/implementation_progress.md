I've successfully implemented the `get_index_stats()` method in the Neo4jIndexManager class to match the functionality provided by JSONIndexManager. The implementation:

1. Uses thread safety with the `_lock` mechanism
2. Handles cases where the driver is not initialized
3. Maps data from `get_index_status()` to the required format
4. Returns a dictionary with all required information:
   - status
   - project_path
   - indexed_files
   - total_symbols
   - symbol_types breakdown
   - languages
   - index_version
   - timestamp
5. Includes proper exception handling

I also created comprehensive unit tests in a new file `test_neo4j_index_manager.py` that verify the method works correctly in all scenarios:
- When the driver is not initialized
- When the index is available
- When the index is not available
- When exceptions occur
- When fields are missing from the status response

All tests passed successfully, confirming that the implementation meets the requirements. The task is now complete, and the Neo4jIndexManager class now has a fully functional `get_index_stats()` method that matches the functionality of JSONIndexManager.

I've also implemented the `save_index()` method in the Neo4jIndexManager class to match the functionality provided by JSONIndexManager. The implementation:

1. Uses thread safety with the `_lock` mechanism to ensure thread-safe operations
2. Calls the existing `_save_neo4j_config()` method to save the Neo4j configuration to a file
3. Includes proper exception handling to catch and log any errors
4. Returns a boolean value indicating success or failure

The `_save_neo4j_config()` method was already implemented and saves the following configuration parameters:
- Neo4j URI
- Neo4j username
- Neo4j password
- Neo4j database name
- Clustering configuration (enabled, k, max_iterations)

I created comprehensive unit tests in a new file `test_save_index.py` that verify the method works correctly in all scenarios:
- When `_save_neo4j_config()` succeeds
- When `_save_neo4j_config()` raises an exception
- Testing the actual `_save_neo4j_config()` method to ensure it correctly saves the configuration
- Testing edge cases like when `config_path` is not set
- Testing exception handling in `_save_neo4j_config()`

All tests passed successfully, confirming that the implementation meets the requirements. The task is now complete, and the Neo4jIndexManager class now has a fully functional `save_index()` method that matches the functionality of JSONIndexManager.

I've successfully completed the implementation of the `find_files()` method in Neo4jIndexManager to match the functionality provided by JSONIndexManager. The implementation includes:

1. Created a test file `test_find_files.py` with comprehensive unit tests for:
   - The `_glob_to_regex` helper method in Neo4jIndexProvider
   - The `search_files` method in Neo4jIndexProvider
   - The `find_files` method in Neo4jIndexManager

2. Implemented the `find_files` method in Neo4jIndexManager that:
   - Uses thread safety with the `_lock` mechanism
   - Handles cases where the index_provider is not initialized
   - Delegates to the index_provider's search_files method
   - Includes proper error handling and logging

3. Enhanced the `search_files` method in Neo4jIndexProvider to:
   - Use a regex-based approach for pattern matching
   - Properly handle glob patterns
   - Include input validation and error handling

4. Fixed issues with the test mocking setup to properly test the Neo4j session interactions:
   - Implemented proper mocking of the Neo4j session context manager
   - Used simple dictionaries for the mock records instead of complex mock objects
   - Configured the mock session with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to simulate context manager behavior

5. Improved the `_glob_to_regex` helper method to:
   - Handle special cases like "*" pattern
   - Properly extract patterns from the `fnmatch.translate` output
   - Ensure patterns start with "^" and end with "$" for proper matching
   - Handle edge cases like patterns ending with ")\\"

All tests are now passing successfully, confirming that the implementation meets the requirements. The task is now complete, and the Neo4jIndexManager class has a fully functional `find_files()` method that matches the functionality of JSONIndexManager.

The implementation provides a robust solution for:
- Converting glob patterns to regex patterns suitable for Neo4j Cypher queries
- Searching for files by pattern in the Neo4j database
- Handling edge cases and error conditions gracefully
- Ensuring thread safety for all operations

I've successfully updated the `refresh_index()` method in Neo4jIndexManager to match the signature and behavior of the JSONIndexManager implementation. The implementation:

1. Updated the method signature to remove the `force: bool = False` parameter to match JSONIndexManager's signature
2. Updated the docstring to match JSONIndexManager's documentation: "Refresh the index (rebuild and reload)."
3. Maintained the core implementation which was already compatible with JSONIndexManager's behavior:
   - Uses thread safety with the `_lock` mechanism
   - Checks if the index_builder is initialized
   - Calls the index_builder's build_index method with clustering parameters
   - Handles exceptions appropriately
   - Returns a boolean indicating success or failure

I also added comprehensive unit tests to the existing `test_neo4j_index_manager.py` file to verify the method works correctly in all scenarios:
- When the index_builder is not initialized
- When the index_builder.build_index() succeeds
- When the index_builder.build_index() fails
- When an exception occurs during the operation
- When using default clustering parameters (not explicitly set)

All tests passed successfully, confirming that the implementation meets the requirements. The task is now complete, and the Neo4jIndexManager class now has a fully functional `refresh_index()` method that matches the functionality of JSONIndexManager.

I've successfully updated the `set_project_path()` method in the Neo4jIndexManager class to automatically initialize the index after setting the project path. The implementation:

1. Modified the `set_project_path()` method to automatically call `initialize()` after setting the project path and creating the configuration directory
2. Ensured the method returns the result of the `initialize()` call, providing a clear indication of success or failure
3. Maintained the existing input validation and error handling:
   - Checks if the project path is valid and exists
   - Creates the configuration directory with proper error handling
   - Logs appropriate messages for success and failure cases

The implementation ensures thread safety by using the existing `_lock` mechanism, which is a reentrant lock (`threading.RLock`). This is important because both `set_project_path()` and `initialize()` use the same lock, and the reentrant nature of the lock allows the same thread to acquire it multiple times without deadlocking.

I also added comprehensive unit tests to the existing `test_neo4j_index_manager.py` file to verify the method works correctly in all scenarios:
- When the path is valid and initialization succeeds
- When the path is invalid (doesn't exist)
- When initialization fails
- When an exception occurs during the operation

All tests passed successfully, confirming that the implementation meets the requirements. The task is now complete, and the Neo4jIndexManager class now has a fully functional `set_project_path()` method that automatically initializes the index, matching the behavior expected by the service layer.

This change ensures that the Neo4jIndexManager behaves consistently with the JSONIndexManager implementation, which the service layer expects. By automatically initializing the index after setting the project path, we eliminate the need for a separate initialization step, simplifying the API and improving usability.
