# Task

## Current Work

We're analyzing code complexity in the `/Users/conor.fehilly/Documents/repos/dst-python-seomax-redesign/src` repository using code-index-mcp tools and Neo4j graph database. We've verified the code index is active and contains 205 files with 1,448 total symbols (277 classes, 1,160 functions).

## Key Technical Concepts

- Neo4j graph database for code structure analysis
- Neo4j GDS (Graph Data Science) algorithms for relationship analysis
- code-index-local MCP tools for code pattern searching
- Code complexity analysis (functions with many parameters, deeply nested code, complex control flow)

## Analysis Plan for Complex Code Identification

### Step 1: Identify Functions with High Complexity

1. __Find functions with many parameters__:

   ```cypher
   MATCH (f:Function)-[:DEFINED_IN]->(file:File)
   RETURN f.name, f.qualified_name, file.path, f.signature
   ORDER BY length(f.signature) DESC
   LIMIT 20
   ```

2. __Locate long function bodies__:

   ```javascript
   search_code_advanced with pattern: def\s+\w+\s*([^)]*):
   context_lines: 15
   ```

### Step 2: Find Deeply Nested Code Structures

1. __Search for high indentation levels__:

   ```javascript
   search_code_advanced with pattern: ^[ \t]{16,}[^ \t]
   ```

2. __Identify large files likely to contain complexity__:

   ```cypher
   MATCH (f:File) 
   WHERE f.language = 'python'
   RETURN f.path, f.line_count 
   ORDER BY f.line_count DESC 
   LIMIT 20
   ```

### Step 3: Identify Complex Control Flow

1. __Multiple nested conditionals__:

   ```javascript
   search_code_advanced with pattern: if.*?:\n.*?(if|elif|else).*?:\n.*?(if|elif|else)
   context_lines: 5
   ```

2. __Complex boolean expressions__:

   ```javascript
   search_code_advanced with pattern: if.*and.*and|if.*or.*and|if.*and.*or
   context_lines: 2
   ```

3. __Multiple exception handling__:

   ```javascript
   search_code_advanced with pattern: try:.*?except.*?except
   context_lines: 5
   ```

### Step 4: Graph-Based Analysis

1. __Centrality analysis__ to find core files/functions:

   ```javascript
   neo4j-gds pagerank tool with nodeLabels: ["File"]
   ```

2. __Community detection__ for tightly coupled modules:

   ```javascript
   neo4j-gds louvain tool with nodeLabels: ["File"]
   ```

### Step 5: Results Compilation

1. Rank top 10 most complex functions
2. Identify files with deepest nesting
3. List areas with most complex control flow
4. Highlight central components that require attention

## Next Steps

Execute the above queries and searches to identify complex code patterns, then compile the results into a comprehensive report highlighting the most complex parts of the codebase.
