## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-11

### üöÄ MAJOR RELEASE - SCIP Architecture Migration

This release represents a **complete architectural overhaul** of the code indexing system, migrating from language-specific analyzers to a unified SCIP-based approach.

#### ‚ú® New Architecture
- **Three-layer service architecture**: Service ‚Üí Tool ‚Üí Technical Components
- **Unified SCIP indexing**: Replace 8 language-specific analyzers with single SCIP protobuf system
- **Service-oriented design**: Clear separation of business logic, technical tools, and low-level operations
- **Composable components**: Modular design enabling easier testing and maintenance

#### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Tree-sitter AST parsing**: Replace regex-based analysis with proper AST parsing
- **SCIP protobuf format**: Industry-standard code intelligence format
- **Reduced complexity**: Simplified from 40K+ lines to ~1K lines of core logic
- **Better error handling**: Improved exception handling and validation
- **Enhanced logging**: Better debugging and monitoring capabilities

#### üì¶ Backward Compatibility
- **MCP API unchanged**: All existing MCP tools work without modification
- **Automatic migration**: Legacy indexes automatically migrated to SCIP format
- **Same functionality**: All user-facing features preserved and enhanced
- **No breaking changes**: Seamless upgrade experience

#### üóëÔ∏è Removed Components
- Language-specific analyzers (C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, Python)
- Legacy indexing models and relationship management
- Complex duplicate detection and qualified name systems
- Obsolete builder and scanner components
- Demo files and temporary utilities

#### üÜï New Services
- **ProjectManagementService**: Project lifecycle and configuration management
- **IndexManagementService**: Index building, rebuilding, and status monitoring
- **FileDiscoveryService**: Intelligent file discovery with pattern matching
- **CodeIntelligenceService**: Code analysis and summary generation
- **SystemManagementService**: File watcher and system configuration

#### üõ†Ô∏è New Tool Layer
- **SCIPIndexTool & SCIPQueryTool**: SCIP operations and querying
- **FileMatchingTool & FileSystemTool**: File system operations
- **ProjectConfigTool & SettingsTool**: Configuration management
- **FileWatcherTool**: Enhanced file monitoring capabilities

#### üìä Performance Benefits
- **Faster indexing**: Tree-sitter parsing significantly faster than regex
- **Lower memory usage**: Streamlined data structures and processing
- **Better accuracy**: SCIP provides more precise code intelligence
- **Improved scalability**: Cleaner architecture supports larger codebases

#### üîÑ Migration Guide
Existing users can upgrade seamlessly:
1. System automatically detects legacy index format
2. Migrates to new SCIP format on first run
3. All existing functionality preserved
4. No manual intervention required

This release establishes a solid foundation for future enhancements while dramatically simplifying the codebase and improving performance.

## [1.2.1] - 2024-08-06

### Fixed
- **File Watcher**: Enhanced move event handling for modern editors (VS Code, etc.)
  - Fixed issue where files created via temp-then-move pattern weren't being detected
  - Improved event processing logic to exclusively check destination path for move events
  - Eliminated ambiguous fallback behavior that could cause inconsistent results

### Improved
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive Pylint compliance improvements
  - Fixed all f-string logging warnings using lazy % formatting
  - Added proper docstrings to fallback classes
  - Fixed multiple-statements warnings
  - Moved imports to top-level following PEP 8 conventions
  - Added appropriate pylint disables for stub methods

### Technical Details
- Unified path checking logic across all event types
- Reduced code complexity in `should_process_event()` method
- Better error handling with consistent exception management
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with improved logging
